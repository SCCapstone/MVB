# "Message in a Virtual Bottle" Oculus Go Virtual Reality App

This project reflects a student's experience at the University of South Carolina (USC) through the use of an Oculus Go virtual reality (VR) headset. The app gives imagery and audio descriptions of student life at USC in VR; it covers a student's journey and showcases the main areas of campus and the Columbia, SC area. The app is primarily designed for MBA students at the Darla Moore School of Business and incoming / prospective undergraduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering as well as the Darla Moore School of Business. It could also be used for distance education students to give them a feel of a student's experience at the university.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

We followed resources online for setting up our development / test environment:\

### Prerequisites

Unity\
Android Studio\
Android Debug Bridge\
Oculus Go\
Computer with decent graphics card

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

TESTING MILESTONE

## Running the tests // CSCE 492

Automated tests are run using the .NET NUnit Framework within Unity for unit testing.
The "Unity UI Test Automation" asset for Unity is used for behavior / UI testing (third party asset).
When booting the project into Unity, going to Windows -> General -> Test Runner will allow the user to test specific tests that have been created (they are in a folder named Tests).
Simply pressing the run test button should test the script.

### Break down into end to end tests // CSCE 492

Unit Tests
1. Checks to see if the quit on click function does what it is supposed to do (i.e. quit the app when a specific object / button in the environment is pressed).

Behavior / UI Tests
1. Runs through the app by going through all scenes to make sure all scenes are reachable.

Give an example
```

### And coding style tests // CSCE 492

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
