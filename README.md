# "Message in a Virtual Bottle" Oculus Go Virtual Reality App

This project aims to reflect a student's experience at the University of South Carolina through the use of an Oculus Go virtual reality (VR) headset. The app will give imagery and audio descriptions of student life at the university in VR and not simply a tour of the campus. It will cover a student's journey from freshman year to senior year, and will be primarily be designed towards MBA students at the Darla Moore School of Business and incoming / prospective undergraduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering as well as the Darla Moore School of Business. It could also be used for distance education students to give them a feel of a student's experience at the university. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

We followed resources online for setting up our development / test environment:\
